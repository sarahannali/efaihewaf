# control

*humans should focus on bigger problems*

## Setup

\`\`\`bash
git clone git@github.com:anysphere/control
\`\`\`

\`\`\`bash
./init.sh
\`\`\`

## Folder structure

**The most important folders are:**

1. \`vscode\`: this is our fork of vscode, as a submodule.
2. \`milvus\`: this is where our Rust server code lives.
3. \`schema\`: this is our Protobuf definitions for communication between the client and the server.

Each of the above folders should contain fairly comprehensive README files; please read them. If something is missing, or not working, please add it to the README!

Some less important folders:

1. \`release\`: this is a collection of scripts and guides for releasing various things.
2. \`infra\`: infrastructure definitions for the on-prem deployment.
3. \`third_party\`: where we keep our vendored third party dependencies.

## Miscellaneous things that may or may not be useful

##### Where to find rust-proto definitions

They are in a file called \`aiserver.v1.rs\`. It might not be clear where that file is. Run \`rg --files --no-ignore bazel-out | rg aiserver.v1.rs\` to find the file.

## Releasing

Within \`vscode/\`:

- Bump the version
- Then:

\`\`\`
git checkout build-todesktop
git merge main
git push origin build-todesktop
\`\`\`

- Wait for 14 minutes for gulp and ~30 minutes for todesktop
- Go to todesktop.com, test the build locally and hit release
